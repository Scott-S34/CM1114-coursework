                        <h6> 
                            Q (born 14th March 1976) is a new Yorker who worked as a fireman before collaborating with some of his high-school friends to form the impractical jokers.
                            <br></br>
                            No matter where challenges are filmed, Q always knows how to trip up the other jokers duirng their turns
                            as well as create some twists during his own turns. From the creation of detective Tony Gunk to having an extended argument with a man we only know as 
                            "Mustache". 
                            <br></br>
                            A memorable punishment he has faced involved dressing up as Peter Pan for a musical which then turned out to be a wrestling 
                            match against WWE Champion, Tommy Dreamer.

                        <h4>James "Murr" Murray</h4>
                        <h6>
                            Murr (born 1st May 1976) was born in new Jersey but was raised in New York. before impratical jokers, he was a director and writer for the movie
                            "Damned".
                            <br></br>
                            Despite Murr's several wins across the seasons he has come off as "nervous" by his slight neck twitches 
                            after being told what to do and say. He also goes under the nickname "Ferret" from his loud high-pitched screams of fear when he went skydiving for 
                            the first time despite

                        <h6>
                            Another memorable punishment Murr has faced involved him being hung up as a human pinata...then after some time Joe's brother in law stopped by
                            to get to hit the pinata too! But after these crazy punishemnts his ability to take a joke always shines through.

                        <h4>Sal Vulcano</h4>
                        <h6>
                            Sal (born 6th November 1976) was born and raised in Staten island, New York. Before the ipractical jokers, he got a degree in Finance.
                            <br></br>
                            When it comes to challenges involving focus groups or presentations, his composure drops the fastest with some jokes
                            being just too hilarious for him to say out loud to a group of random strangers. He has been progressing through every challenge 
                            and punishment despite his fear of cats, tight spaces and germs which have helped to make some of Sal's reactions 
                            the most hilarious across every season.
                            <br></br>
                            As a joker, Sal wins the award for most punished joker. One of his most gruelling punishments to date is
                            getting a Jaden Smith tatoo on his thigh, but of ccourse, this is one of many. The list goes on and on. 
                            When it comes to Sal punishments, they may be a bit frequent but undoubtedly funny.

                        <h4>Joe Gatto</h4>
                        <h6> 
                            Joe (born 5th June 1976) was also bon in Staten Island, New York. As of now, Joe was a part of the Impractical Jokers from the beginning, 
                            in 2011. In 2022 Joe left the quartet after going through a divorce from his wife and to focus on looking after his children and pets. 
                            <br></br>
                            On the show, Joe was very skilled in catching the other jokers out to have them fail in challenges or to suprise them further in punishments. He has 
                            been the most difficult joker to punish and has had a low loss record from his courage and lack of shame in multiple instances.
                            He is fearful of almost nothing!
                            <br></br>
                            One of Joes biggest punishements involved walking into his house which was completely wrapped in gift wrap.This punishment was implemented soon after his own birthday.
